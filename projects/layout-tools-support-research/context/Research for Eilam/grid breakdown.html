These problems often stem from fixed heights, elements placed outside gridlines, and limited automatic adaptation, leading to layout breaks on mobile, tablet, and large screens.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">37</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1352302051R2" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">3</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Spacing, Padding, &amp; Alignment Issues </td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Users faced various layout and spacing problems caused by section grid settings and element behavior. Issues included overlapping or misaligned cells due to margin or fixed height conflicts, excessive or unexplained white space from scaling or responsive settings, confusion over gaps, padding, and page margins, immovable grid cells causing layout breaks, and elements extending outside gridlines causing horizontal scroll. Sticky section grids sometimes caused scrolling bugs or hidden content. Live site display differed from the editor due to sticky positioning or max width settings. Some grids did not adapt properly on mobile or tablet views, causing layout and alignment issues. Percentage-based columns ignored gaps, affecting grid structure. Margin and padding controls often didn’t work as expected within grids.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">27</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1352302051R3" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">4</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Grid Cell &amp; Section Manipulation Difficulties</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Users are facing significant challenges managing section grids and cells in Wix Studio, including difficulties resizing, moving, duplicating, or deleting cells and sections due to rigid grid structures and unresponsive controls. These limitations often cause overlapping, misalignment, and layout inconsistencies, especially across different breakpoints and device views. The unclear interaction between grid elements and editor tools leads to confusion and prevents users from effectively customizing their layouts.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">20</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1352302051R4" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">5</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Confusion &amp; Lack of Understanding of Layout Tools </td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Users face recurring problems with managing section grids and spacing in Wix Studio, including unexpected overlaps caused by margin adjustments and difficulties controlling gaps between cells. Many struggle with confusion around grid padding, gaps, and responsive behavior settings, leading to excessive white space, misaligned elements, and layout inconsistencies across breakpoints. Additional issues arise from sticky or fixed grid settings causing hidden sections, scrolling glitches, and improper scaling, which affect both editor experience and live site display.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">14</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1352302051R5" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">6</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Grid System Limitations &amp; Inflexibility </td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Users face significant limitations with Wix Studio’s grid and repeater features, including inability to customize the number of columns or rows, resize grids as a whole, or duplicate individual cells. Many are frustrated by preset layouts and locked grid heights that restrict proportional scaling and flexibility, while some features like gradient overlays or text wrapping around images are simply unavailable. These constraints cause challenges in designing layouts that deviate from fixed structures, limiting creativity and control over the site’s visual arrangement.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">20</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1352302051R6" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">7</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">UI/Visual Aid Issues &amp; Editor Discrepancies </td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Users are frequently encountering persistent grid lines or guides appearing on their Wix Studio sites or editors, often without clear understanding of how they were enabled or how to disable them. These grid lines sometimes appear only during editing or screen sharing, and can be confusing or disruptive, especially since Wix Studio is designed as an adaptive platform without traditional grid overlays. The inability to easily toggle these visual aids off causes frustration and hampers the editing experience, particularly when working on large breakpoints or mobile views.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">10</td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1352302051R7" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">8</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Workflow &amp; Stability Concerns </td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Users are facing critical issues with site stability and workflow disruptions, such as progress being lost despite auto-save, particularly when using undo actions that cause layout elements like CSS grid columns to revert unexpectedly. Additionally, delays and inefficiencies arise when manipulating elements in the Layers panel, especially when moving items between different containers or grids. Advanced mode settings and responsiveness problems also contribute to layout instability, with elements unexpectedly shifting positions when switching between desktop and mobile views.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">5</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
