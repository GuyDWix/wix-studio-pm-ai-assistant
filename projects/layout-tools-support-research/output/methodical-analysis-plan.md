# Methodical Analysis Plan - Tool-Type Focused Data Review

## Issue Identified
- Mixed up tool types with category names (e.g., "Page/Section" category assigned to "Stack" tool)
- Combined issues across tools that should be separate
- Need to organize by tool type as primary pivot, not issue severity
- Missing tool-specific gap/overlap issues that may be distinct per tool

## Systematic Approach

### Phase 1: Raw Data Extraction by Tool Type
Go through each breakdown file individually and extract ALL categories for that specific tool:

#### 1.1 Stack Tool Analysis
**Source**: `stack breakdown.html`
- Extract ALL categories from stack research
- Identify which categories relate to gaps/overlaps/spacing specifically for stacks
- Note exact problem descriptions and occurrence counts
- **Focus**: Stack-specific container behavior, stacking alignment, stack gaps

#### 1.2 Section Grid Tool Analysis  
**Source**: `section grid breakdown.html`
- Extract ALL categories from section grid research
- Identify section grid-specific gaps/overlaps/spacing issues
- Note grid cell behavior, section spacing, grid alignment problems
- **Focus**: Section-level grid behavior, cell spacing, grid layout issues

#### 1.3 Grid Tool Analysis (General Grid)
**Source**: `grid breakdown.html` 
- Extract ALL categories from general grid research
- Identify grid-specific spacing and alignment issues
- **Focus**: Grid system behavior, grid spacing controls

#### 1.4 CSS Grid Tool Analysis
**Source**: `css grid breakdown.html`
- Extract ALL categories from CSS Grid research  
- Identify CSS Grid-specific manipulation and spacing issues
- **Focus**: CSS Grid element positioning, CSS Grid layout controls

#### 1.5 Repeater Tool Analysis
**Source**: `repeater breakdown.html`
- Extract ALL categories from repeater research
- Identify repeater-specific layout alignment and spacing issues
- **Focus**: Repeater item spacing, repeater alignment, repeater layout behavior

#### 1.6 Flex Layout Tool Analysis  
**Source**: `flex layout breakdown.html`
- Extract ALL categories from flex layout research
- Identify flexbox-specific spacing and alignment issues
- **Focus**: Flexbox alignment, flex item spacing, flex layout controls

### Phase 2: Tool-Specific Issue Cataloging
For each tool, create detailed breakdown:
- **Tool Name**: [Specific Tool]
- **Total Occurrences**: [Sum of all issues for this tool]
- **Categories**: [List each category with description and count]
- **Gap/Overlap/Spacing Issues**: [Highlight these specifically]
- **Other Issues**: [Non-spacing tool functionality issues]

### Phase 3: Create Tool-Focused CSV
**Structure**:
```
tool_type,category,occurrences,priority_level,problem_type,specific_description,impact_summary
Stack,Category Name 1,X,High,Spacing,"Specific stack spacing problem","Impact on stack usage"
Stack,Category Name 2,Y,Medium,Functionality,"Stack-specific limitation","Impact on stack usage"
Section Grid,Category Name 1,Z,Critical,Overlaps,"Section grid overlap problem","Impact on section grid"
```

### Phase 4: Cross-Tool Analysis
- Compare similar issues across tools (are spacing problems universal or tool-specific?)
- Identify patterns and differences
- Create tool-specific strategic recommendations

### Phase 5: Validation
- Verify each issue is correctly attributed to its source tool
- Ensure no mixing of categories across tools
- Confirm total occurrences match source data

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Each category is only assigned to its source tool breakdown
- [ ] All gap/overlap/spacing issues are captured per tool
- [ ] No categories are mixed between tools
- [ ] Occurrence counts match source data exactly
- [ ] Tool types are primary organizing principle

## Expected Outcome
**Tool-focused analysis** showing:
1. **Stack Tools**: [X issues, Y spacing-related]
2. **Section Grid Tools**: [X issues, Y spacing-related] 
3. **Grid Tools**: [X issues, Y spacing-related]
4. **CSS Grid Tools**: [X issues, Y spacing-related]
5. **Repeater Tools**: [X issues, Y spacing-related]
6. **Flex Layout Tools**: [X issues, Y spacing-related]

This approach ensures each tool's specific problems are properly identified and not mixed with other tools.
