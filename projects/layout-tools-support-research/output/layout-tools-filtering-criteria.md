# Layout Tools Filtering Criteria & Analysis

## Objective
Filter the 40 layout issue categories to focus specifically on **layout tools functionality** rather than responsive design, performance, or workflow issues.

## Filtering Criteria Definition

### ✅ **KEEP - Layout Tools Specific Issues:**
Issues directly related to the design, functionality, limitations, or usability of layout tools themselves (Grid, Stack, Repeater, CSS Grid, Flexbox, etc.)

### ❌ **FILTER OUT - Non-Layout Tools Issues:**
Issues related to responsive behavior, performance, workflow, technical bugs, or user education rather than core tool functionality
