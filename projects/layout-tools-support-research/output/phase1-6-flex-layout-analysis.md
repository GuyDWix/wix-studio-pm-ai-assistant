## Flex Layout Tool Categories (From Flex Layout Breakdown)

### 1. **Difficulty with Core Layout Controls & Editor Functionality** - **7 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users struggles with fundamental interactions and controls within the editor's layout system
- **Root Issues**: Challenges with element management (copying, adjusting properties), understanding layout hierarchies (layers, sections), unexpected interferences between layout tools and other site features
- **Type**: **Control/Usability Issue**
- **Impact**: Layout tools feel overly technical or unintuitive, users cannot effectively manage basic flex layout functions

### 2. **Flexbox & Responsive Layout Rendering Issues** - **5 occurrences**
- **Problem**: User difficulties where Flexbox layouts fail to render correctly across different screen sizes, leading to visual distortions like overlapping elements, misalignment, or unwanted white space
- **Root Issues**: Flexbox rendering problems across breakpoints, alignment and spacing issues
- **Type**: **Spacing/Rendering Issue**
- **Impact**: Makes responsive design tedious and error-prone, requiring users to seek complex workarounds or support intervention

### 3. **Layout Tool Feature Parity & Flexibility Limitations** - **5 occurrences**
- **Problem**: User frustrations stemming from a perceived lack of consistent features or flexibility between different Wix editors (Wix Editor vs. Wix Studio) or between specific layout tools (Flexbox vs. Repeater)
- **Root Issues**: Inconsistent feature availability across different editors, limitations compared to other layout tools
- **Type**: **Feature Limitation Issue**
- **Impact**: Forces users to switch tools mid-workflow or compromises design intent due to limitations, making layout tools feel overly technical or limiting

### 4. **App/Component-Specific Responsive & Customization Limitations** - **5 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Issues where specific Wix applications or pre-built components (tables, menus, portfolio galleries, events apps) inherently lack the necessary responsiveness or customization options
- **Root Issues**: Components don't work well with flexbox layouts, lack of customization options for responsive behavior
- **Type**: **Integration/Customization Issue**
- **Impact**: Challenging for users to achieve desired layouts across different screen sizes, lack of pre-breakpoint flexibility makes responsive design tedious or error-prone
