## **Recommendation**

**75.6% of our analysis is clearly layout tools-focused** ✅

**24.4% needs verification** - Should we:
1. **Keep borderline issues** if they're tool-specific manifestations?
2. **Remove borderline issues** to maintain pure layout tools focus?
3. **Reclassify borderline issues** with clearer criteria?

The main topics show we successfully focused on **tool functionality, spacing, control, and usability** rather than broader layout problems.
