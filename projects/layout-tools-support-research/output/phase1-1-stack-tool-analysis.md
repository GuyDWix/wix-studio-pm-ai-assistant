# Phase 1.1: Stack Tool Analysis

**Source**: `stack breakdown.html`
**Methodology**: Extract ALL categories that appear in stack-specific research

## Stack Tool Categories (From Stack Breakdown)

### 1. **Elements Overlapping or Misaligning on Page/Section** - **77 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users struggling with layout instability caused by improper stacking behaviors, inconsistent container and grid configurations, and conflicting responsive settings across breakpoints
- **Root Issues**: Elements not correctly constrained within grids or stacks, changes at one breakpoint affect others
- **Type**: **Spacing/Overlap Issue**
- **Impact**: Overlapping elements, misaligned sections, broken layouts when resizing

### 2. **Unpredictable Spacing and Gaps** - **14 occurrences**  
- **Problem**: Users experiencing excessive gaps and inconsistent spacing across layouts, primarily due to misconfigured stacks, hidden elements, and rigid layout settings
- **Root Issues**: Improper stack alignment, fixed margins, lack of responsive constraints
- **Type**: **Spacing/Gap Issue**
- **Impact**: White space, unexpected gaps, uneven element positioning on mobile, tablet, and large screens

### 3. **Difficulty with Fine-Grained Control and Manipulation of Stacked Elements** - **18 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users facing alignment and resizing challenges due to restrictive stack and container behaviors, snapping constraints, and limited flexibility when unstacking elements
- **Root Issues**: Rigid structures, difficulty managing responsive adjustments across breakpoints
- **Type**: **Control/Manipulation Issue**  
- **Impact**: Can't achieve precise positioning, resizing, or reordering without breaking layout

### 4. **Limitations with Specific Layout Components/Behaviors** - **21 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users having trouble creating and controlling stacking and layout effects across devices. Issues include difficulty stacking cards/text on mobile, customizing responsive stack behaviors, arranging footers, limitations of repeaters not supporting different layouts per item
- **Root Issues**: Restrictions or greyed-out options, gallery elements overlapping/stacking incorrectly
- **Type**: **Functionality Limitation**
- **Impact**: Cannot achieve desired stacking layouts, forced into rigid structures

### 5. **Confusion and Learning Curve for Stacking/Responsive Design** - **12 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users facing confusion and frustration due to lack of clear understanding and guidance on how to use stacks, containers, and layering
- **Root Issues**: Scarce up-to-date resources, unclear responsive design workflows
- **Type**: **Usability/Learning Issue**
- **Impact**: Difficulties aligning elements properly, ensuring smooth transitions between breakpoints

### 6. **Unintended Cascading Changes Across Breakpoints** - **10 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users facing challenges with stacking and breakpoint management that cause changes made in mobile or tablet views to unintentionally impact desktop layout
- **Root Issues**: Lack of proper isolation between breakpoints
- **Type**: **System Behavior Issue**
- **Impact**: Layout shifts, spacing problems, inconsistent element behavior across devices

### 7. **Editor Bugs and Unreliable Behavior** - **9 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users encountering technical glitches and instability within the Wix editor that prevent proper stacking, editing, and interaction with elements
- **Root Issues**: Unresponsive/hidden elements, broken hover effects, editing freezes, rendering bugs
- **Type**: **Technical Bug**
- **Impact**: Disrupted workflows, inability to effectively manage layout and design features
