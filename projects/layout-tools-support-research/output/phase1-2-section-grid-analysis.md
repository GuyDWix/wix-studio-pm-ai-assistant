## Section Grid Tool Categories (From Section Grid Breakdown)

### 1. **Overlapping Elements & Unwanted Spacing (Visual Clutter)** - **37 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users face layout issues like shifting or overlapping elements, unwanted white space, and misaligned grids
- **Root Issues**: Elements outside gridlines, locked grid sizes, improper padding/margins, section heights. Responsive design breaks due to grid constraints, layering errors, difficulty adjusting spacing
- **Type**: **Spacing/Overlap Issue**
- **Impact**: Layout breaks especially on mobile, gaps appear only on live sites due to grid limitations

### 2. **Responsive Design Difficulties & Breakpoint Management** - **37 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users facing multiple responsiveness and layout issues across different breakpoints, especially on mobile and tablet views
- **Root Issues**: Misaligned elements, overlapping buttons, inconsistent cell ordering, sections displaying incorrectly due to rigid or improper grid setups
- **Type**: **System/Responsive Issue** 
- **Impact**: White space, hidden content, poor visual consistency between desktop and mobile versions

### 3. **Difficulty Adjusting Grid/Cell Sizing & Structure** - **32 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users encountering limitations and difficulties with resizing and adjusting section grids and cells
- **Root Issues**: Unable to change cell sizes due to fixed/locked grid templates, auto-sizing behaviors, conflicting margin and padding settings. Resize handles don't appear or changes revert unexpectedly
- **Type**: **Control/Sizing Issue**
- **Impact**: Grid structures causing unwanted white space, overlapping elements, difficulties adding new content

### 4. **Workflow Friction & User Confusion** - **30 occurrences**  
- **Problem**: Users face difficulties with selecting and adjusting section grids, confusion about grid structure, containers, and galleries
- **Root Issues**: Struggle with moving/swapping cells and elements within grids, unclear on layout behavior on different devices, lack of drag-and-drop for certain grids
- **Type**: **Usability/Learning Issue**
- **Impact**: Challenges understanding tutorials and terminology around sections, containers, and grids

### 5. **Limitations & Rigidity of Grid Tools** - **14 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users face limitations with section grids including inability to copy or save grids as assets, restrictions on placing grids in headers
- **Root Issues**: No layer renaming within repeaters, inability to duplicate flexbox cells or sticky section cells, difficulty adding elements spanning multiple cells
- **Type**: **Functionality Limitation**
- **Impact**: Cannot place content outside predefined grid structure, missing features like gradient overlays or anchor links

### 6. **General Layout/Editor Bugs & Instability** - **10 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users face issues with section grids and layouts such as header text displaying incorrectly on live site, inability to revert to previous layout after switching to CSS grid
- **Root Issues**: Missing background colors in grids, locked section grid heights, undeletable empty rows, accidental deletions without undo options
- **Type**: **Technical Bug**
- **Impact**: Section grids not displaying properly, broken section grids on specific pages

### 7. **Sticky/Scrolling Effects Issues** - **7 occurrences**
- **Problem**: Users report issues with sticky sections and scrolling effects in section grids
- **Root Issues**: Sections not scrolling properly affecting whole site, mobile scrolling effects not working, sticky banners splitting into grids instead of staying fixed
- **Type**: **Feature/Effect Issue**
- **Impact**: Elements disappearing due to conflicting sticky settings, uncontrollable background scrolling causing content cutoff
