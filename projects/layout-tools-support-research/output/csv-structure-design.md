# CSV Structure Design for Layout Tools Issues

## Purpose
Create a CSV file optimized for Google Sheets analysis, filtering, and prioritization of layout tools-specific issues.

## Column Design

| Column Name | Type | Description | Purpose |
|-------------|------|-------------|---------|
| `rank` | Integer | Issue ranking (1-17) | Easy sorting and priority identification |
| `category` | Text | Full category name | Primary issue identification |
| `tool_type` | Text | Specific tool (Grid, Stack, Repeater, CSS Grid, Flex, General) | Tool-based filtering and analysis |
| `occurrences` | Integer | Number of support tickets | Quantitative impact assessment |
| `priority_level` | Text | High (20+), Medium (10-19), Low (5-9), Minor (2-4) | Quick priority categorization |
| `problem_description` | Text | Brief problem summary | Understanding the core issue |
| `impact_summary` | Text | Business/user impact | Understanding consequences |
| `percentage_of_total` | Decimal | Percentage of total layout tools issues | Relative importance |

## Sheet Import Optimization Features

### Filtering Capabilities:
- **Tool Type**: Filter by specific layout tools
- **Priority Level**: Focus on High/Medium priority issues  
- **Occurrences Range**: Filter by volume thresholds
- **Impact Type**: Tool limitations vs. usability vs. control issues

### Sorting Options:
- **By Occurrences**: Highest impact first
- **By Tool Type**: Group related issues
- **By Priority Level**: Focus on critical items
- **Alphabetical**: Easy lookup

### Analysis Features:
- **Percentage Column**: Shows relative impact 
- **Priority Grouping**: Pre-categorized priority levels
- **Tool Distribution**: Easy tool-based analysis
- **Impact Categories**: Different types of problems

## Sample Data Structure Preview

```csv
rank,category,tool_type,occurrences,priority_level,problem_description,impact_summary,percentage_of_total
1,Repeater-Specific Layout/Behavior Limitations,Repeater,42,High,Inherent limitations in repeater functionality affecting layout flexibility,Core tool cannot meet user layout requirements,16.6%
2,Confusion/Misunderstanding of Repeater Functionality,Repeater,37,High,Users struggling to understand and properly implement repeater functionality,Tool design/usability preventing successful usage,14.6%
```

## Usage Instructions for Sheets

### Recommended Initial Views:
1. **Priority Dashboard**: Filter by "High" priority, sort by occurrences descending
2. **Tool Analysis**: Group by tool_type, sum occurrences for each tool
3. **Impact Assessment**: Sort by percentage_of_total descending

### Useful Formulas:
- **Tool Totals**: `=SUMIF(C:C,"Repeater",D:D)` (sum occurrences for Repeater)
- **Priority Counts**: `=COUNTIF(E:E,"High")` (count high priority issues)
- **Average Impact**: `=AVERAGE(D:D)` (average occurrences per issue)
