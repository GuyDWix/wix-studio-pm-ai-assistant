## Phase 1: Interaction Mapping & Journey Analysis

### 1.1 Conversation Flow Documentation
**Goal**: Map the complete bidirectional user-AI journey and decision points
- **Chronicle key moments**: Initial request → Task selection → Execution → Corrections → Final outcome
- **Identify AI decision trees**: Where did AI choose approaches, tools, or interpretations?
- **Document user interventions**: When did user need to correct or redirect?
- **Track framework usage**: Which rules/tasks were invoked and how effectively?
- **Map user communication patterns**: How did user provide guidance, corrections, and clarifications?

### 1.2 User Interaction Analysis
**Goal**: Understand user communication patterns and effectiveness
- **Initial request analysis**: How clear/ambiguous was the original ask? What assumptions did it require?
- **Guidance effectiveness patterns**: Which user interventions were most/least effective?
- **Communication style analysis**: Direct commands vs. questions vs. examples vs. corrections
- **Timing of interventions**: When did user step in? Early prevention vs. late correction patterns
- **Clarity and specificity levels**: Where was user guidance precise vs. where did it leave room for interpretation?
- **User feedback quality**: Which corrections led to better AI performance vs. continued confusion?

### 1.3 Error Pattern Analysis (AI Side)
**Goal**: Categorize and understand AI failure modes
- **Categorize errors**: Interpretation errors, methodology errors, scope errors, execution errors
- **Root cause analysis**: Framework gaps vs. AI application vs. unclear requirements vs. poor user communication interpretation
- **Error cascade analysis**: How initial errors compounded downstream and which user interventions broke the cascade
- **Recovery patterns**: What interventions successfully corrected course and why?

### 1.4 Communication Breakdown Analysis (Both Sides)
**Goal**: Identify where user-AI communication failed and succeeded
- **Assumption gaps**: Where did AI make wrong assumptions about user intent?
- **Requirement specification gaps**: What should user have specified upfront vs. what AI should have asked?
- **Feedback loop efficiency**: How quickly were miscommunications identified and corrected?
- **Prevention opportunities**: Where could clearer initial communication have prevented downstream errors?
- **Expectation management**: How well did AI communicate its approach for user validation before execution?

### 1.5 Pitfall Pattern Analysis & Prevention Strategies
**Goal**: Learn from user experience to identify and prevent common failure modes
- **Common user frustration points**: What patterns of AI behavior consistently required user correction?
- **Effective user intervention strategies**: Which user approaches successfully redirected AI work?
- **Early warning signals**: What should AI look for to catch potential errors before they compound?
- **User communication red flags**: What types of user requests are most likely to lead to misinterpretation?
- **Success recovery patterns**: How did effective user-AI collaboration recover from initial mistakes?
- **Prevention framework design**: How can we build guardrails to prevent identified pitfalls?

## Phase 2: Framework Performance Evaluation

### 2.1 Current Framework Assessment
**Goal**: Evaluate how existing rules/tasks performed
- **Rule effectiveness audit**: Which @task rules worked well vs. poorly?
- **Gap identification**: What tasks/scenarios lacked adequate framework support?
- **Usage pattern analysis**: How were rules combined and sequenced?
- **Knowledge base utilization**: How effectively was @shared-knowledge leveraged?

### 2.2 Missing Framework Elements
**Goal**: Identify absent but needed framework components
- **Data analysis frameworks**: Systematic approaches for filtering, categorizing, analyzing datasets
- **Validation/verification frameworks**: Methods for checking work quality and accuracy

- **User-AI collaboration patterns**: Most productive interaction modes
- **Framework combinations**: Effective rule combinations and sequences
- **Quality control moments**: When validation/verification worked

### 3.2 User Experience Insights & Communication Best Practices
**Goal**: Understand optimal user-AI interaction patterns from both perspectives
- **Effective user guidance patterns**: When was user direction most/least helpful to AI?
- **AI communication clarity**: Best practices for explaining approach and rationale to users
- **User communication optimization**: How could user requests/corrections be more effective?
- **Iteration efficiency**: Optimal feedback loops and correction cycles from both sides
- **Cognitive load management**: How to reduce user effort while maintaining quality
- **Prevention strategies**: How can users structure initial requests to avoid common pitfalls?
- **Expectation setting**: How should AI communicate its interpretation before proceeding?
