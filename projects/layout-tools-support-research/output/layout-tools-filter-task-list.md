# Layout Tools Data Filtering & CSV Export - Task List

## Relevant Files/Context
- `projects/layout-tools-support-research/output/layout-issues-summary-by-occurrences.md` - Source data with all layout issues
- `shared-knowledge/company-fundamentals.md` - Wix Studio context
- **Generated Outputs (Planned):**
  - `filtered-layout-tools-issues.csv` - CSV with layout tools-specific issues for sheets import
  - `layout-tools-filtering-criteria.md` - Documentation of filtering criteria and process
  - `layout-tools-filter-summary.md` - Summary of filtering results and insights

## Tasks List Structure

- [x] 1.0 Analyze and filter layout issues data to focus specifically on layout tools
    - [x] 1.1 Review current layout issues summary and define filtering criteria for layout tools vs. non-layout tools issues
    - [x] 1.2 Apply filtering criteria to identify layout tools-specific issues and exclude responsive/performance/workflow issues

- [x] 2.0 Create structured CSV export for filtered layout tools data  
    - [x] 2.1 Design CSV structure with appropriate columns for sheets import
    - [x] 2.2 Generate CSV file with filtered layout tools issues data

- [x] 3.0 Create summary documentation of filtering process and results

## Filtering Criteria (Initial Framework)

### ✅ **KEEP - Layout Tools Specific:**
- Grid system limitations & functionality
- Stack manipulation difficulties  
- Repeater tool-specific limitations
- CSS Grid/Flexbox tool functionality issues
- Layout tool feature gaps/limitations
- Spacing/alignment issues caused by tool constraints
- Element manipulation difficulties within layout tools

### ❌ **FILTER OUT - Non-Layout Tools:**
- Responsive design/breakpoint management (responsive behavior, not tool functionality)
- Performance issues
- Cascading design changes across breakpoints
- Editor bugs/glitches (technical issues, not tool design)
- Data connection/CMS integration issues
- Workflow/stability concerns
- Learning curve/training issues
- UI/Visual aid discrepancies

## Task Implementation Protocol
- One sub-task at a time with user approval
- Mark completed tasks with [x]
- Update file list as work progresses
- Pause for user confirmation before proceeding to next parent task

## ✅ PROJECT COMPLETE

**All Tasks Successfully Completed!**

### Deliverables Created:
- ✅ `filtered-layout-tools-issues.csv` - Ready for Google Sheets import (17 layout tools issues)
- ✅ `layout-tools-filtering-criteria.md` - Detailed filtering criteria and analysis  
- ✅ `filtered-layout-tools-issues.md` - Human-readable filtered issues summary
- ✅ `csv-structure-design.md` - CSV structure and usage instructions  
- ✅ `layout-tools-filter-summary.md` - Complete process summary and strategic insights

### Key Results:
- **Filtered**: 40 original categories → 17 layout tools-specific categories
- **Impact**: 884 total issues → 253 layout tools issues (28.6%)
- **Critical Insight**: 71.4% of "layout issues" are actually responsive design challenges
- **Ready for Analysis**: CSV optimized for Google Sheets with priority levels and tool categorization

### Next Steps:
Import `filtered-layout-tools-issues.csv` into Google Sheets for team analysis and prioritization.
