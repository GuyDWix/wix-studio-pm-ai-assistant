# Methodical Analysis Complete - Tool-Focused Layout Issues Summary

## What You Asked For
"Go over the raw data, and let's make the main pivot of the table the tool type - i.e. we will have all the issues related to stack (gaps and overlaps is one of which) then all related to section grid, then css grid, repeater, layout and every other layout tool type."

## What Was Corrected

### **Previous Errors:**
1. **Mixed tool attributions** - "Elements Overlapping" was incorrectly assigned to "Stack" tool type when it appeared in multiple tool breakdowns
2. **Missed tool-specific issues** - Each tool had distinct categories that weren't properly separated
3. **Incorrect filtering** - Combined issues across tools instead of keeping them tool-specific

### **Methodical Approach Used:**
1. **Phase 1**: Systematic extraction from each tool's breakdown file individually
2. **Phase 2**: Tool-specific cataloging with proper attribution  
3. **Phase 3**: Tool-focused CSV with tool_type as primary pivot
