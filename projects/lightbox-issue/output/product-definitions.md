# Wix Studio Lightbox Modal: Product Definitions & Solution Strategy

## Problem Statement

**Core Issue**: The Wix Studio lightbox modal creates a frustrating user experience that undermines our mission to help professionals create websites they're proud of.

### Specific Technical Problems

#### 1. Content Overflow Without Scroll Access
**Problem**: Lightbox content container uses `position: absolute` pinning, allowing content to exceed the 100vh wrapper without creating internal scrolling.

**User Impact**: 
- Users cannot access content below the fold in lightboxes
- Critical information, controls, or form fields become unreachable
- Forces users to abandon lightbox interactions or find workarounds

#### 2. Background Website Scroll Behavior
**Problem**: The website behind the lightbox overlay remains scrollable despite being visually covered.

**User Impact**:
- Confusing interaction - users attempt to scroll thinking it will reveal more lightbox content
- Breaks expected modal behavior patterns
- Creates cognitive load and frustration during focused tasks

#### 3. Missing Responsive Content Management
**Problem**: Absence of "full height" responsive package prevents proper lightbox sizing and content flow management.

**User Impact**:
- Inconsistent lightbox behavior across device sizes
- Poor mobile/tablet experience for professional creators
- Inability to handle varying content lengths gracefully

## Business Impact Analysis

### User Experience Consequences
- **Professional Credibility**: Poor modal behavior reflects negatively on Studio's professional-grade positioning
- **Workflow Disruption**: Users forced to close and reopen lightboxes to access content
- **Mobile Professional Use**: Particularly problematic for professionals working on-the-go

### Strategic Alignment Impact
- **Quality Excellence**: Violates our zero-tolerance policy for user experience issues
- **Professional Value**: Undermines trust in Studio as a professional-grade platform
- **User Love**: Creates frustration instead of pride in the creation process

## Solution Strategy & Recommendations

**Technical Scope**: CSS/styling changes to lightbox component architecture
**Risk Level**: Low - standard modal behavior implementation
**User Value**: Immediate access to all lightbox content

#### Solution 2: Implement Background Scroll Lock
