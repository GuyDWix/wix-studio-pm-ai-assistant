# Product Announcement Email Methodology

## When to Use
- Announcing new features to the team
- Communicating product releases
- Sharing milestone updates with stakeholders

## Process

### 1. Gather Required Details (only ask if not provided)
- **Team Name**: What team is announcing?
- **Feature Name**: What's the feature called?
- **Feature Status**: Open to employees | % rollout | all users
- **Images**: Any visuals to include?
- **Feature Description**: Brief explanation
- **Next Steps**: What happens after announcement?
- **Acknowledgments**: Who to thank?
- **Known Issues**: Any limitations? (optional)

### 2. Generate Email Structure
- **Subject Line**: `[Status] Team: Feature Name`
- **Opening**: Express excitement
- **What Is It?**: Brief explanation and significance
- **Why This Matters**: Benefits and importance
- **Next Steps**: Clear action items
- **Known Issues** (if any): Transparency about limitations
- **Acknowledgments**: Thank contributors
- **Closing**: Friendly sign-off

### 3. Tone Guidelines
- Semi-professional and friendly
- Professional business/technical terms
- Celebrate the milestone appropriately
- Use emojis tastefully (don't overdo)
- Easy to scan and read
