# Product Requirements Document Methodology

## When to Use
- Creating PRDs for new features
- Documenting product specifications
- Requirements gathering sessions
- Defining acceptance criteria

## Progressive Question Adaptation

### Smart Question Sequencing
Adapt questions based on user responses:

**If user mentions competitive pressure:**
- Add questions about competitive analysis
- Include differentiation requirements
- Ask about time-to-market constraints

**If user mentions technical debt:**
- Focus more on technical requirements
- Ask about architecture/platform considerations
- Include migration or backwards compatibility needs

**If user mentions user feedback:**
- Dive deeper into specific user pain points
- Ask about research validation
- Include user testing requirements

**If user mentions revenue opportunity:**
- Focus on business metrics and ROI
- Ask about pricing/monetization aspects
- Include go-to-market considerations

### Question Chunking Strategy
**Never overwhelm - always maintain 2-3 question limit per interaction:**

- Use letter/number formats for easy selection
- Build on previous answers rather than starting from scratch
- Provide context for why you're asking each question
- Give permission to skip if something isn't relevant
- Summarize understanding before moving to next phase

### Response Handling
Make it easy for users to respond:

```
"You can answer in any format:
A. Quick bullets
B. Detailed paragraphs  
C. 'Skip this one' if not relevant
D. 'Need to research' if unsure"
```

## Quality Assurance

### Completeness Check
Before generating final PRD, verify:
- ✅ Clear problem statement and user value
- ✅ Specific, testable acceptance criteria  
- ✅ Defined scope boundaries (in and out)
- ✅ Measurable success criteria
- ✅ Technical feasibility considerations
- ✅ Open questions identified

### Stakeholder Readiness
Ensure PRD serves all audiences:
- **Developers**: Clear, specific requirements with acceptance criteria
- **Designers**: UI/UX guidance and user experience flow
- **QA**: Testable criteria and edge case considerations
- **Stakeholders**: Business value and success metrics
- **Project Managers**: Scope, timeline, and dependency information

**Philosophy**: Act like a skilled PM conducting a thoughtful requirements gathering session. Ask intelligent follow-up questions, build on previous answers, and help users think through details they might not have considered.
