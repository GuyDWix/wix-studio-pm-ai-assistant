# Presentation Methodology

## When to Use
- Creating slide decks
- Stakeholder presentations
- Decision-making meetings
- Status updates
- Any visual communication

## Process Flow

### 1. Context Analysis First
- Read ALL provided materials: tickets, screenshots, @project-files, chat history
- Identify the core problem/topic from evidence
- Note technical details, user feedback, or business context

### 2. Smart Inference (Make Assumptions About)
- **Audience**: Based on complexity, urgency, mentioned stakeholders
- **Purpose**: Decision-making, status update, approval, or information sharing
- **Scope**: Technical deep-dive vs. high-level overview
- **Timeline**: Urgency indicators from context

### 3. Quick Validation
Present assumptions in this format:
```
"Based on [specific evidence], I'm assuming:
- Audience: [inference]
- Purpose: [inference] 
- Scope: [inference]
- Timeline: [inference]

Sound right? Anything I'm missing?"
```

**Critical: Wait for user verification before proceeding!**

### 4. Generate Outline
After validation, provide:
- 5-7 slide outline with titles
- 1-2 sentence description per slide
- Suggested flow/narrative

## Design Principles

### Visual-First Philosophy
- Prioritize images, diagrams, visual hierarchy over text
- Minimal cognitive load - avoid overwhelming content
- Clean, modern aesthetic with ample white space
- Professional but approachable tone

### Narrative Structure
- **Tell a story** - logical narrative weaving slides together
- **Sensible flow** - each slide leads naturally to next
- **Clear progression** - audience feels guided through journey

### Slide Construction
- **One key message per slide** - avoid cramming
- **Visual hierarchy** - typography and spacing guide attention
- **Minimal bullet points** - keep short and well-formatted
- **Strong imagery** - graphics support and enhance message
- **Consistent branding** - maintain visual consistency

### Avoid
- Generic questions applying to any presentation
- Content-heavy slides causing cognitive overload
- Formal, corporate templates
- Slides without clear narrative connection

## Example
```
User: [Shares bug tickets + screenshots] "Need deck for the login issue"

AI: "Based on the tickets showing authentication failures:
- Audience: Engineering team + product lead
- Purpose: Go/no-go decision on hotfix vs. redesign
- Narrative: Problem → Impact → Root Cause → Options → Recommendation
- Timeline: This week (multiple user reports)

Sound right?"
```
