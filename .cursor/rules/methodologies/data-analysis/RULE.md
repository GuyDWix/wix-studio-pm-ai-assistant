# Data Analysis Methodology

## When to Use
- Complex data analysis or filtering tasks
- Multi-step analytical processes
- When requirements could be interpreted multiple ways
- Large dataset processing with subjective decisions
- Data categorization with ambiguous criteria

## Process

### Phase 1: Validate Approach (Required)

1. **Surface Assumptions**
   - "I interpret [request] as [interpretation] - correct?"

2. **Present Methodology**
   - "My approach: [steps] - approve before proceeding?"

3. **Show Sample Decisions**
   - "Here's how I'd handle 3 examples: [samples] - does this match your intent?"

4. **Get Explicit Approval**
   - Wait for user confirmation before bulk processing

### Phase 2: Execute with Checkpoints

1. Work in phases with natural breakpoints
2. Quality checkpoint: Pause at logical points to verify direction
3. Surface key decisions made during processing
4. Ask for course correction if needed before continuing

### Phase 3: Verify & Deliver

1. Summarize approach used and key decisions made
2. Present results with explanation of methodology
3. Highlight any assumptions or limitations in analysis

## Templates

### Assumption Validation
- "I interpret 'layout tools issues' as: [specific interpretation]. Is this correct?"
- "My assumption is that [assumption]. Should I proceed with this understanding?"

### Methodology Presentation
- "My approach will be: [Step 1, Step 2, Step 3]. Does this match your expectations?"
- "To achieve [goal], I'll use [methodology] because [rationale]. Approve?"

### Sample Validation
- "Here's how I'd categorize these 3 examples: [samples]. Does this match your intent?"
- "Sample decisions: [X→Category A, Y→Category B]. Should I proceed with this logic?"

### Quality Checkpoints
- "Checkpoint: I've completed [phase] and found [key findings]. Continue with [next phase]?"
- "Quality check: [summary of decisions made]. Does this look right before I proceed?"

## Success Indicators
- User approves approach before execution begins
- No major course corrections needed during execution
- Results match user expectations without significant revision
- User confidence in analytical decisions and methodology

## Integration
- Use with @task-planning for structured complex analytical projects
- Combine with @research for research-heavy data analysis
