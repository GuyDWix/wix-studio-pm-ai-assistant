# Research Methodology

## When to Use
- User research projects
- Market analysis
- Competitive intelligence
- Any multi-source investigation

## Research Plan Definition & Approval

**Before executing any research:**

1. **Define scope explicitly:**
   - What specific questions will be answered?
   - What sources will be investigated?
   - What deliverables will be created?
   - What is the expected timeline?

2. **Present plan for approval:**
   - Outline the 3-phase approach
   - Specify folder structure and outputs
   - Get explicit "yes" before proceeding

3. **Create research structure:**
   ```
   projects/[project-name]/research/[topic]-research/
   ├── findings/
   ├── synthesis/
   └── final-output/
   ```

## 3-Phase Research Process

### Phase 1: Explore & Triangulate
**Goal:** Cast wide net, find diverse perspectives, identify patterns

- **Source Mapping:** Identify 3-5 different source types
- **Broad Collection:** Gather initial insights from each source
- **Finding Documentation:** Save in `findings/` folder
- **Pattern Recognition:** Look for convergent themes and contradictions
- **Gap Identification:** Document what's missing

**Output:** Separate findings file per source (`[source-type]-[topic]-findings.md`)

### Phase 2: Synthesize & Model
**Goal:** Turn raw findings into frameworks and structured insights

- **Insight Consolidation:** Group findings into themes
- **Framework Creation:** Build mental models explaining the data
- **Contradiction Analysis:** Resolve or explain conflicts
- **Synthesis Documentation:** Save in `synthesis/` folder
- **Implication Mapping:** What does this mean?

**Output:** Synthesis files (`[theme]-synthesis.md`)

### Phase 3: Distill & Deliver
**Goal:** Create sharp, actionable output for decision-making

- **Key Insight Extraction:** Identify 3-5 most important findings
- **Recommendation Formation:** Develop actionable recommendations
- **Executive Summary:** One-page sharp summary
- **Final Output:** Save in `final-output/` folder

**Output:** Executive summary, detailed recommendations, key findings reference

## Quality Principles

### Source Diversity
- **Primary sources:** Direct from companies, users, experts
- **Secondary sources:** Reports, articles, analysis
- **Community sources:** Forums, social media
- **Data sources:** Surveys, analytics

### Triangulation Method
- **Convergent validation:** Multiple sources saying same thing
- **Contradiction analysis:** Sources disagreeing (often most interesting)
- **Perspective diversity:** Different stakeholder viewpoints
- **Temporal validation:** How has this changed over time?

### Sharp Output
- Executive summary: Key findings in 1 page
- Actionable recommendations: What to do next
- Evidence backing: Support for key claims
- Decision framework: Help audience make choices
