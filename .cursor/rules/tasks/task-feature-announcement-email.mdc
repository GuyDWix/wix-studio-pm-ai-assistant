## Prompt for Generating Product Announcement Emails

### Instructions:
1. **Gather Minimal Required Details**: Ask the user for the following information - ONLY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE IT ALREADY. Ask these questions one at a time and wait for a response:
   - **Team Name**: What is the name of your team?
   - **Feature Name**: What is the name of the new feature?
   - **Feature Status**: Is this feature [Open to employees | open to <rollout-pecent>] | open to ALL users | other <stated-by-user>
   - **Image**: Are there any images to include? If yes, ask them in you context of a reference to them
   - **What is the feature about**: Ask the user to briefly explain about the feature or use any reference to context for you
   - **Next Steps**: What are the next steps following the announcement?
   - **Acknowledgments**: Who should be thanked in the email? (List names)
   - **Known Issues/Limitations**: Are there any known issues or limitations to mention? (Optional)

2. **Generate the Email**: Based on the provided details, create an email that follows this structure:
   - **Subject Line**: Clearly state the feature and its status.
   - **Opening**: Express excitement about the new feature.
   - **What Is It?**: Provide a brief explanation of the feature and its significance.
   - **Why This Matters**: Explain the benefits and importance of the feature.
   - **Next Steps**: Outline the upcoming actions in a clear format.
   - **Known Issues/Limitations (optional)**: If provided, include this section to inform users of any relevant issues.
   - **Acknowledgments**: Thank team members for their contributions.
   - **Closing**: End with a friendly sign-off.

3. **Tone of voice**: We use a semi-professional and friendly tone. You do not need to be overly-formal.
    - Be professional in your usage of business and technical terms
    - Hype a bit about the fact this is a good milestone
    - Use emojis (but in good taste - don't over do it!)
    - Be consie and make the email easy to scan and read, unless the user asked something else.

**Subject:** [Open to Employees] Wix Studio: New Responsive Checker

**Body:**
Hi everyone,

We‚Äôre excited to share that the Responsive Site Checker is now available for all Wix employees üéâ! 
This tool replaces our old "site checker"; it helps detect and fix common responsiveness issues, making it easier to build well-structured and optimized websites.


## What is it
The Responsive Site Checker allows users to scan pages for sizing, layout, and positioning issues, and detects potential problematic structure and responsive design instances.

The checker allows you to view what pages they scanned and when to make sure they don't miss issues as they progress with their site building.
Users can select to apply immediate fixes from the panel with a single click, view the issue on stage and solve it themselves, or dismiss issues if they are intentional design choices.

### Education
We also included topic specific tutorial videos for each issue category, which explain why these issues might occur and how to prevent them.

### First 6 Issue Detections Available at Launch
For this phase the checker is targeting specific recurring responsive issues that our users encounter. We will be adding more issues to the checker in the future to improve it and make it more helpful.

#### Current Rules
* Small Text on Some Screens ‚Äì When text is smaller than 12px on any given breakpoint.
Fix: Apply a minimum font size.

* Unstacked Elements That should be stacked ‚Äì Sibling elements that are not in any responsive layout tool and can cause layout issues.
Fix: Stack items.
some.gif

* Docking Conflict ‚Äì Item is close to parent's bottom while docked to the top, creating unwanted gaps.
Fix: Change docking to bottom.

* Section Grid With Max-Width On ‚Äì A grid inside a section using max-width won‚Äôt cover it fully across all screens.
Fix: Disable global max-width.
some.gif

* Multi-Column Grid on Mobile ‚Äì Grids with more than two columns in mobile that may cause content overflow.
Fix: Adjust layout to a single column on mobile.
some.gif

* Unnecessary Margins - Element has unnecessary margins that blocks parent‚Äôs resizing
Fix: Remove unnecessary margins

## Known issues
We have several known issues that should be fixed soon or are waiting for merge. 
Menu and header in blank templates have unnecessary margins that need to be removed.
Improving stacking logic to consider cases when items are in different CSS grid areas
Adding indication for potential stack fixes when "viewing on canvas"
Excluding hidden elements from scan.

## Next steps
After making sure all critical fixes are applied, we will open for users in an A/B test.
