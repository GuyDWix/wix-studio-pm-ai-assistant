## Minimal Project Setup

### Lightning-Fast Project Creation
[CRITICAL]: Follow these steps in THIS EXACT ORDER!

1. **Make sure there is no existing project already created**
   - If you suspect there is redundancy, let the user know and ask them what to do (create a new project or reuse existing one)
2. **Create Basic Project Structure**
   ```
   mkdir -p projects/[simple-name]/context && mkdir -p projects/[simple-name]/output
   ```
3. **Add Relevant Context Reference**
- Based on the user intent, ONLY from the `@shared-knowledge/`, read relevant information and remember it as part of your context; there's no need to copy them into the project
- Always start with `@shared-knowledge/company-fundamentals.md` to get the basis context about the company and main product
- KEY PRINCIPAL: Start with minimal context. Add shared knowledge files only when specific gaps are identified during the conversation.

4. Notify the user that the project was created and wait for further instructions
