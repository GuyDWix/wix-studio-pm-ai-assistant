# Adaptive Research Framework

## Research Plan Definition & Approval

**Before executing any research, you must follow these:**

1. **Assure the research scope is explicitly defined:**
   - What specific questions will be answered?
   - What sources will be investigated?
   - What deliverables will be created?
   - What is the expected timeline?

2. **Present the research plan to the user for approval before starting:**
   - Outline the 3-phase approach
   - Specify the folder structure and outputs
   - Get explicit "yes" before proceeding

3. **Use/create the research structure:**
   ```
   projects/[project-name]/research/[project-simple-name]-research/
   ├── findings/
   ├── synthesis/
   └── final-output/
   ```

## Research Execution Process

### **Phase 1: Explore & Triangulate**
**Goal:** Cast wide net, find diverse perspectives, identify patterns

**Standard Process:**
- **Source Mapping:** Identify 3-5 different source types for this research
- **Broad Collection:** Gather initial insights from each source type
- **Finding Documentation:** Save all findings in `research/[project-name]-research/findings/`
- **Pattern Recognition:** Look for convergent themes and contradictions
- **Gap Identification:** Document what's missing or what new questions emerged

**Output Requirements:**
- Each source investigation creates a separate findings file
- Name format: `[source-type]-[topic]-findings.md`
- Each file includes: source details, key insights, relevant quotes, initial analysis

### **Phase 2: Synthesize & Model**
**Goal:** Turn raw findings into frameworks, models, or structured insights

**Standard Process:**
- **Insight Consolidation:** Group findings into coherent themes
- **Framework Creation:** Build mental models or frameworks that explain the data
- **Contradiction Analysis:** Resolve or explain conflicting information
- **Synthesis Documentation:** Save analysis in `research/[project-name]-research/synthesis/`
- **Implication Mapping:** What does this mean for the target audience?

**Output Requirements:**
- Create synthesis files that reference findings
- Name format: `[theme]-synthesis.md` or `[framework]-analysis.md`
- Each synthesis file includes: supporting evidence, contradictions addressed, implications

### **Phase 3: Distill & Deliver**
**Goal:** Create sharp, actionable output for decision-making

**Standard Process:**
- **Key Insight Extraction:** Identify the 3-5 most important findings
- **Recommendation Formation:** Develop actionable recommendations
- **Executive Summary Creation:** One-page sharp summary
- **Final Output Documentation:** Save in `research/[project-name]-research/final-output/`
- **Evidence Backing:** Detailed support for key claims

**Output Requirements:**
- Executive summary (1 page)
- Detailed recommendations with evidence
- Key findings reference document
- All outputs reference supporting findings and synthesis files

## Task List Integration

**This research framework should leverage the existing `@task-create-task-list.mdc` template:**. Go over it if needed to make sure you apply the processes in it for the research execution monitoring

## Output Structure Requirements

### **Folder Structure:**
```
projects/[project-name]/research/[project-simple-name]-research/
├── findings/
│   ├── [source-type]-[topic]-findings.md
│   ├── [source-type]-[topic]-findings.md
│   └── ...
├── synthesis/
│   ├── [theme]-synthesis.md
│   ├── [framework]-analysis.md
│   └── ...
└── final-output/
    ├── executive-summary.md
    ├── detailed-recommendations.md
    └── key-findings-reference.md
```

## Research Orchestration Protocol

**When research is needed, use this process:**

1. **Define research scope** (what questions, sources, deliverables, timeline)
2. **Present plan to user** and get approval
3. **Create research workspace** with proper folder structure
4. **Generate task list** using task-create-task-list format
5. **Execute research** following the 3-phase process
6. **Document everything** in the structured output format
7. **Create final deliverables** for decision-making

## Quality Principles

### **Source Diversity**
- **Primary sources:** Direct from the source (companies, users, experts)
- **Secondary sources:** Analysis and interpretation (reports, articles)
- **Community sources:** Real-world experience (forums, social media)
- **Data sources:** Quantitative validation (surveys, analytics)

### **Triangulation Method**
- **Convergent validation:** Multiple sources saying the same thing
- **Contradiction analysis:** Sources disagreeing (often most interesting)
- **Perspective diversity:** Different stakeholder viewpoints
- **Temporal validation:** How has this changed over time?

### **Progressive Refinement**
- **Start broad:** Get the landscape
- **Go deep:** Focus on key areas
- **Iterate:** New findings change the questions
- **Synthesize:** Turn research into insights

### **Sharp Output**
- **Executive summary:** Key findings in 1 page
- **Actionable recommendations:** What to do next
- **Evidence backing:** Support for key claims
- **Decision framework:** Help audience make choices
