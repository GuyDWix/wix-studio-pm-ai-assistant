description: This rule enables smart, assumption-based slide deck assistance. Instead of asking lengthy questionnaires, analyze provided context (tickets, screenshots, files) to make informed inferences about audience, purpose, and approach. Present assumptions for quick validation, then generate visual-first, narrative-driven slide decks that follow company design principles.

# Slide Deck Creation Rule

## Process Flow

### 1. Context Analysis First
- Read ALL provided materials: tickets, screenshots, @project-files, chat history
- Identify the core problem/topic from evidence
- Note any technical details, user feedback, or business context

### 2. Smart Inference (Make Assumptions About)
- **Audience**: Based on complexity, urgency, and mentioned stakeholders
- **Purpose**: Decision-making, status update, approval, or information sharing
- **Scope**: Technical deep-dive vs. high-level overview
- **Timeline**: Urgency indicators from tickets/context

### 3. Quick Validation
Present assumptions in this format:
```
"Based on [specific evidence], I'm assuming:
- Audience: [inference]
- Purpose: [inference] 
- Scope: [inference]
- Timeline: [inference]

Sound right? Anything I'm missing?"
```

Critical: wait for the user to verify your assumptions!

### 4. Generate Outline ASAP
After validation, provide:
- 5-7 slide outline with titles
- 1-2 sentence description per slide
- Suggested flow/narrative

## Company Slide Design Principles

### Visual-First Philosophy
- **Audience are visual thinkers** - prioritize images, diagrams, and visual hierarchy over text blocks
- **Minimal cognitive load** - avoid content-heavy slides that overwhelm
- **Clean, modern aesthetic** - follow examples like clean typography, ample white space, strong visual hierarchy
- **Not overly formal** - professional but approachable tone and design

### Narrative Structure
- **Tell a story** - create logical underlying narrative that weaves slides together
- **Sensible flow** - each slide should lead naturally to the next
- **Clear progression** - audience should feel guided through a journey, not just consuming information

### Slide Construction Guidelines
- **One key message per slide** - avoid cramming multiple concepts
- **Visual hierarchy** - use typography, spacing, and layout to guide attention
- **Minimal bullet points** - when used, keep them short and well-formatted
- **Strong imagery** - photos, illustrations, or graphics should support and enhance the message
- **Consistent branding** - maintain visual consistency throughout

### Avoid
- Generic questions that apply to any presentation
- Content-heavy slides that cause cognitive overload
- Formal, corporate presentation templates
- Slides without clear narrative connection

## Example Application
```
User: [Shares bug tickets + screenshots] "Need deck for the login issue"

AI: "Based on the tickets showing authentication failures and the error screenshots, I'm assuming:
- Audience: Engineering team + product lead (technical + some business context)
- Purpose: Go/no-go decision on immediate hotfix vs. planned redesign
- Narrative: Problem → Impact → Root Cause → Solution Options → Recommendation
- Style: Visual-first with screenshots, minimal text, clean layout following our design principles
- Timeline: This week (multiple user reports)

Sound right? Anything I'm missing?"
