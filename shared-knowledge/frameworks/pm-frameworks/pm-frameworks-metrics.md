# Metrics & Success Measurement Frameworks

*Frameworks for success measurement, KPI tracking, and performance analysis*

## HEART Framework (Google)
**Purpose**: Measure user experience comprehensively

**Metrics**:
- **Happiness**: User satisfaction (surveys, NPS)
- **Engagement**: User involvement (DAU, sessions)
- **Adoption**: New user uptake (signups, first use)
- **Retention**: User return rate (repeat usage)
- **Task Success**: Completion rates (conversion, success rate)

**Application**: Choose 1-2 HEART metrics per product area

**Implementation Process**:
1. **Goals**: Define what you want to improve
2. **Signals**: Identify user behaviors that indicate success
3. **Metrics**: Choose specific, measurable signals

**Studio HEART Example**:
```
Goal: Improve Partner site creation experience

Happiness: Site creation satisfaction survey
Engagement: Time spent in editor per session
Adoption: % of Partners who create their first site
Retention: % of Partners who return within 7 days
Task Success: % of Partners who publish their site
```

**Studio PMF Assessment**:
```
Partners:
- Sean Ellis score for Studio vs regular Wix
- Monthly retention rate for premium Partners
- Organic Partner acquisition rate
- Partner referral and recommendation rates

Self Creators:
- Studio adoption among existing Wix users

## Engagement Metrics Framework

### **Core Engagement Metrics**:
- **DAU/MAU Ratio**: Stickiness (daily/monthly users)
- **Session Length**: Time spent per visit
- **Session Frequency**: Visits per user per period
- **Feature Adoption**: % users using key features
- **Depth of Usage**: Actions per session

### **Engagement Calculation Examples**:
```
Stickiness = DAU Ã· MAU
(Higher = more frequent usage)

Feature Adoption Rate = Active Feature Users Ã· Total Users
(Measure feature value)

Engagement Score = (Frequency Ã— Depth Ã— Breadth) Ã· 3
(Composite engagement measure)
```

### **Studio Engagement Focus**:
- **Creation Sessions**: Time spent actively building
- **Feature Exploration**: Breadth of tools used
- **Project Completion**: Sites published vs started
- **Collaboration Usage**: Multi-user features adoption
