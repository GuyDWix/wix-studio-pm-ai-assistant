# Strategic Product Management Frameworks

*Frameworks for product discovery, strategy definition, and opportunity identification*

## Opportunity Solution Trees (Teresa Torres)
**Purpose**: Visualize product discovery work and the path to desired outcomes

**When to Use**: 
- Managing complex product discovery
- Connecting customer opportunities to business solutions
- Maintaining alignment during continuous discovery

**How it Works**:
1. **Outcome**: Business metric you want to improve (top of tree)
2. **Opportunities**: Customer needs, pain points, desires discovered through research
3. **Solutions**: Product/feature ideas that address specific opportunities
4. **Experiments**: Tests to validate solution assumptions

**Key Benefits**:
- Prevents jumping straight to solutions without understanding opportunities
- Enables systematic exploration of the problem space
- Creates visual alignment for product teams

**Modern Application**: Essential for teams practicing continuous product discovery

**Wix Studio Application**: 
- Map Partner agency needs vs Self Creator needs
- Connect Studio capabilities to business outcomes
- Visualize competitive differentiation opportunities

## Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework
**Purpose**: Understand the fundamental job customers hire your product to do

**Core Question**: "What job is the customer hiring this product to accomplish?"

**Framework Elements**:
- **Functional Job**: The task or problem to be solved
- **Emotional Job**: How the customer wants to feel
- **Social Job**: How the customer wants to be perceived

**Application Process**:
1. Identify the job through customer interviews
2. Map the job steps and pain points
3. Measure success criteria
4. Design solutions for job completion

**Integration**: Works exceptionally well with Opportunity Solution Trees

**Wix Studio JTBD Examples**:
- **Partners**: "Help me create professional websites efficiently for multiple clients"
- **Self Creators**: "Help me build a beautiful website that represents my business professionally"
- **Emotional Jobs**: Feel confident, creative, professional
- **Social Jobs**: Be perceived as skilled, modern, successful

## Shape Up (Basecamp)
**Purpose**: Alternative to traditional agile for reducing uncertainty and improving focus

**Key Principles**:
- **6-week cycles** instead of sprints
- **Circuit breakers** - hard stop after 6 weeks
- **Appetite setting** - define how much time a problem is worth
- **Pitching process** - betting table decides what to build

**Core Components**:
1. **Shaping**: Define the problem and solution approach
2. **Betting**: Choose what to work on
3. **Building**: Execute with small teams

**When to Use**: Teams struggling with endless feature requests and unclear priorities

**Adaptation for Wix Studio**:
- Use appetite setting to balance Partner vs Self Creator investments
- Apply circuit breakers to experimental features
- Shape problems around specific user journey pain points

## Continuous Product Discovery (Teresa Torres)
**Purpose**: Structure ongoing product discovery

**Weekly Habits**:
- Conduct customer interviews
- Map opportunities from research
- Generate and test solutions
- Measure outcomes

**Key Principle**: Small, consistent discovery activities beat large, infrequent research projects

**Implementation Framework**:
1. **Interview Customers Weekly**: Maintain constant user contact
2. **Map Opportunities**: Use research to populate opportunity solution trees
3. **Generate Solutions**: Create multiple options for each opportunity
4. **Test Assumptions**: Run small experiments before building

**Studio Implementation**:
- Regular Partner and Self Creator interviews
- Opportunity mapping for design vs AI initiatives
- Solution experimentation for new capabilities

## Story-Based Interviewing
**Purpose**: Understand real user behavior through specific examples

**Question Format**: "Tell me about the last time you..."

**Benefits**:
- Reveals actual behavior vs stated behavior
- Uncovers contextual factors
- Provides concrete examples for design decisions

**Framework**: Focus on specific, recent, real experiences

**Studio Interview Examples**:
- "Tell me about the last time you created a website for a client..."
- "Walk me through the last project where you struggled with..."
- "Describe the most recent time you felt frustrated with..."

---

## OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
**Purpose**: Align teams around measurable outcomes

**Structure**:
- **Objective**: Qualitative goal (what you want to achieve)
- **Key Results**: Quantitative measures (how you'll know you succeeded)

**Best Practices**:
- 3-5 Key Results per Objective
- 70% achievement rate is ideal
- Bottom-up input from teams
- Regular check-ins and updates

**Product Team Application**: Product outcomes should ladder up to business OKRs

**Studio OKR Examples**:
- **Objective**: "Become the go-to platform for professional web creators"
- **Key Results**: 
  - Increase Partner premium conversion to X%
  - Achieve Y% Partner retention rate
  - Reach Z active Studio sites

## North Star Framework
**Purpose**: Align organization around single meaningful metric

**Components**:
- **North Star Metric**: One metric that best captures customer value
- **Input Metrics**: Leading indicators that drive the North Star
- **Work Streams**: Areas of focus to improve inputs

**Examples**:
- Airbnb: Nights booked
- Spotify: Time spent listening
- WhatsApp: Messages sent

**Studio North Star Options**:
- **Professional Sites Created**: Captures core value delivery
- **Partner Success Rate**: Focus on professional user outcomes
- **User Creation Hours**: Measures engagement and value

## Strategic Framework Selection Guide

### **Quick Selection Matrix**:

| Challenge | Best Framework | Secondary Support |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Unclear user problems** | Opportunity Solution Trees | Story-Based Interviewing |
| **Too many feature requests** | Shape Up + JTBD | Continuous Discovery |
| **Misaligned team priorities** | OKRs | North Star Framework |
| **Uncertain product direction** | JTBD + OST | Continuous Discovery |
| **Need systematic discovery** | Continuous Discovery | OST + Story Interviews |

### **Framework Combinations**:
- **Discovery Stack**: OST + Continuous Discovery + Story Interviewing
- **Alignment Stack**: OKRs + North Star + JTBD
- **Focus Stack**: Shape Up + OKRs + OST
