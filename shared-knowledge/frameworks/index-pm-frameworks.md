# PM Frameworks - Modular System
This index provides a complete decision tree to help you choose the right framework for your specific PM challenge.

## ðŸ“š **Specialized Framework Files**

| Domain | File | When to Use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Strategic Discovery** | `@pm-frameworks-strategic.md` | Understanding user problems, product strategy, discovery planning |
| **Feature Prioritization** | `@pm-frameworks-prioritization.md` | Ranking features, resource allocation, decision frameworks |
| **Development Methods** | `@pm-frameworks-development.md` | Agile processes, team coordination, delivery planning |
| **Success Measurement** | `@pm-frameworks-metrics.md` | KPI tracking, user research metrics, business outcomes |
| **AI-Enhanced PM** | `@pm-frameworks-ai.md` | Prompt engineering, automated workflows, AI-assisted analysis |

## ðŸš€ **Quick Navigation by Common Needs**

### "I need to understand user problems"
â†’ `@pm-frameworks-strategic.md` (Opportunity Solution Trees, JTBD)

### "I need to decide what to build next"
â†’ `@pm-frameworks-prioritization.md` (RICE, ICE, Value vs Effort)

### "I need to plan development work"
â†’ `@pm-frameworks-development.md` (Dual-Track Agile, Continuous Discovery)

### "I need to measure success"
