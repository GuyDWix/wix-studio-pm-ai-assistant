# Studio Editor User Types


**Document Purpose:** This document provides the foundational context on the target users for "Studio Editor". It focuses on the motivations and attributes of our users, independent of any specific technology or solution.

## **1. Our Strategic Focus: A Clear Hierarchy**

Our strategy is built around a clear understanding of who we serve.

*   **Primary Persona: The Professional Creator.**
    This is our core business focus and the user for whom we build. They are freelancers, agencies, and marketers creating websites and applications *as a service for clients*. Their success is our success.

*   **Secondary Persona: The DIY User.**
    This is a user we must support with accessible, intuitive experiences. **They must not be ignored or alienated.** However, they are critically less important than our primary persona. We will not prioritize features that exclusively serve the DIY user at the expense of professional-grade capabilities.

## **2. Understanding Our Primary Persona**

### The Spectrum of Professionalism**

    "Professional Creator" is NOT a synonym for "expert in all things." This group exhibits a vast spectrum of skills and backgrounds. A user's professional *intent* (building for a client) is distinct from their *capabilities*.

    *   A user might be a brilliant **marketer** who excels at strategy but is less confident in visual design.
    *   A user might be a talented **designer** who creates stunning visuals but dreads the technical aspects of responsiveness or SEO.
    *   A user might be a skilled **developer** who needs to rapidly build front-ends without being constrained by an opinionated design tool.
    *   A user might be a great salesman and builder of basic websites, but with low skills in all related tasks (design, marketing, SEO, etc.).

    Our platform must empower all of them, recognizing that a "professional" is defined by their client-facing work, not by a uniform skill set.


### The Level of Ceritainty Framework: Three Core User Archetypes

Our users arrive on the platform with diverse starting points and intentions, shaped not only by their skill levels but also by the specific project, clients, and current phase of their work. As they engage with our product, their sense of certainty fluctuates — both in terms of their goals and their prevailing intent, whether it is to achieve results quickly or to explore and find inspiration. 

While these states are dynamic, we offer here a generalized framework of archetypes that capture a user's dominant mindset and approach to a project. These should be used as a base framing for our users and not as a dogmatic source of truth:

#### **Archetype A: The Executor (Fidelity-Driven)**

*   **Core Identity:** "I have a clear and specific vision (or pre-made design). My primary goal is to implement it with absolute precision, control, and faithfulness to the original plan."
*   **Key Identifiers & Behaviors:**
    *   They approach projects with a high degree of certainty, often originating from a pre-existing design (e.g., in Figma) or a meticulously planned mental model.
    *   They value granular control over all aspects of the design: layout, spacing, typography, and styling.
    *   They often work "top-down," defining a design system or structural rules *before* building out pages.
    *   They see the editor as an **execution environment**—a tool to translate a known quantity into a functional product.
*   **Core Anxiety:** **Imprecision & Lack of Control.** The fear that the tool will be an obstacle to their vision, introducing compromises, preventing perfect replication, or forcing them into workarounds.
*   **Mock Interview Snippet:** *"I've already sold the client on the design we perfected in Figma. Now, I need an editor that gets out of my way and lets me build *that* exact thing. If the tool fights me on spacing or forces its own styling opinions on me, it's useless."*

#### **Archetype B: The Output Oriented (Velocity-Driven)**

*   **Core Identity:** "I need to deliver a professional, high-quality result fast; I have a lot of projects in-line. My primary goal is to minimize time spent on foundational work and accelerate to a finished product."
*   **Key Identifiers & Behaviors:**
    *   Often focused on the business or marketing goals of the site, they may be less specialized in design or development and might work more on small or generic website projects in scale.
    *   They actively seek out well-structured starting points, such as high-quality templates, pre-built sections, or automated generation tools.
    *   Their workflow is often one of **adaptation and rebranding**—taking a solid foundation and infusing it with the client's specific brand and content.
    *   They prioritize "good enough" over "pixel-perfect" if it means faster delivery.
*   **Core Anxiety: Wasted Effort & Fragility*. This reflects the fear of investing time in a starting point that proves fragile, hard to customize, or ultimately demands more effort to fix than it saved. A related concern is producing results that appear overly generic, failing to demonstrate the unique value of using their services over standard templates.
*   **Mock Interview Snippet:** *"Give me a rock-solid foundation that looks professional, let me quickly apply the client's brand and content, and get out of the way. The worst outcome is a template that breaks the moment I try to change anything."*

#### **Archetype C: The Ceative Seeker (Inspiration-Driven)**

*   **Core Identity:** "I am a creative problem-solver who excels at strategy, but I'm not always a source of infinite design ideas. My primary goal is to translate a client's abstract 'vibe' into a concrete, compelling visual direction."
*   **Key Identifiers & Behaviors:**
    *   They begin projects with a low degree of certainty—a client's brief, a "vibe," or a set of business goals, but no clear visual plan.
    *   They often feel "stuck" in the early, conceptual phase of a project, struggling to translate abstract ideas into tangible designs.
    *   They naturally look for external inspiration to help kick-start their own creative process.
    *   Their process is iterative and exploratory; they need to see several different options to be able to identify and build confidence in the strongest one.
*   **Core Anxiety:** **Creative Dead Ends & The Blank Canvas.** The deep-seated fear of getting stuck without inspiration, staring at an empty page, and being unable to produce a compelling creative vision that will win the client's approval.
*   **Mock Interview Snippet:** *"The client said they want something 'fresh and trustworthy.' I've been staring at a blank page for an hour because I don't know what that *looks* like for a law firm. I'm great at the strategy, but sometimes I just need a spark—a few different starting points—to get my own creativity flowing. Without that, I can't even begin to build a compelling pitch for them."*
